## TypeScript Guidance

- **Strict mode**: Assume `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`. Add explicit types to exported functions, node/credential descriptions, and complex objects.
- **Module/Target**: Use CommonJS imports/exports compatible with Node 20 and `target: es2019`.
- **Libs**: Prefer modern JS APIs available in `es2019`+.
- **OutDir**: Do not import from `dist/`. Source files should import from `nodes/**` and `credentials/**` only.
- **JSON imports**: Allowed via `resolveJsonModule`; prefer constants files for static data.
- **Error handling**: With `useUnknownInCatchVariables: false`, type caught errors appropriately and narrow before access.
- **File placement**: Keep node operations, descriptions, and helper utilities co-located under their node folder. Share cross-node types in `nodes/types`.
